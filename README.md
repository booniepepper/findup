Usage: findup FILE

Finds a directory containing FILE. Starts at the current working directory, and
searches "up" through each parent directory.

When a directory is found, it is printed to stdout.

If no directory containing FILE is found, nothing is printed, and the
program exits with an exit code of 1.
